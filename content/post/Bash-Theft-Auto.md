# Bash Theft Auto: A Terminal-Based Crime Game You Didn't Know You Needed

If you've ever wanted to commit digital crimes in the comfort of your terminal, *Bash Theft Auto* might just be your new favorite toy.

Inspired by the chaos and freedom of the *Grand Theft Auto* series, this project reimagines that same energy — but in your command line.

## What is Bash Theft Auto?

[Bash Theft Auto](https://github.com/stuffbymax/Bash-Theft-Auto) (BTA) is a text-based crime simulation game built entirely in Bash. Created by [Max Bridgland](https://github.com/stuffbymax), it's a lightweight, humorous take on the open-world crime genre — playable from any Unix-based terminal.

It's ridiculous. It's crude. It's surprisingly fun.

## Features

#### "Steal cars, rob banks, get chased by cops — all in your terminal."
<br>

##### Bash Theft Auto lets you:
<br>

- Steal cars and get away with it (sometimes).

- Rob banks for instant cash (high risk, high reward).

- Run from the cops in a turn-based chase system.

- Buy weapons, upgrade your gear, and get rich.

- Try not to die.

<br>

Everything happens through simple text menus and random event generation, making each playthrough unpredictable.

<br>

## Installation
<br>
Getting started is as easy as cloning the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stuffbymax/Bash-Theft-Auto.git
cd Bash-Theft-Auto
chmod +x ./bta
./bta
