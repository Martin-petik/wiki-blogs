# Stand Up to Scareware with Microsoft Edge's New Scareware Blocker  

## Introduction  

Microsoft Edge is taking a proactive step in protecting users from online scams with its new **Scareware Blocker** feature. Now available in preview, this tool is designed to detect and block malicious full-screen pop-ups that attempt to deceive users into thinking their computer is infected.  

## What is Scareware?  

Scareware refers to deceptive pop-ups that mimic legitimate security warnings, urging users to call a fake support number or download unnecessary (and often harmful) software. These scams use fear tactics, such as:  

- Fake virus alerts with loud alarms  
- Full-screen messages claiming your PC is compromised  
- Fake Microsoft or antivirus notifications urging immediate action  

These tactics often trick users into paying for unnecessary services or giving scammers remote access to their computers.  

## How the Scareware Blocker Works  

Microsoft Edgeâ€™s Scareware Blocker uses **machine learning** to detect and neutralize these threats in real time. When a scareware page is detected, Edge will:  

- **Exit full-screen mode** to prevent scare tactics from taking over the screen  
- **Mute any warning sounds** that create urgency  
- **Show a warning message** with a screenshot of the detected page  

Unlike traditional security tools, this detection happens **locally on your device**, ensuring privacy by not sending browsing data to the cloud.  

## How to Enable the Scareware Blocker  

To activate the Scareware Blocker in Microsoft Edge:  

1. Ensure Edge is **up to date**  
2. Open **Settings** (`...` menu in the top-right corner)  
3. Navigate to **Privacy, search, and services**  
4. Scroll down to the **Security** section  
5. Toggle on **Scareware Blocker**  

After enabling, restart Edge to ensure the feature is fully activated.  

## Why This Matters  

With the rise of online scams, Microsoft Edgeâ€™s **Scareware Blocker** provides an essential layer of protection. By **automatically detecting deceptive tactics** and disrupting scareware attempts, users can browse with greater confidence and security.  

Try out the **Scareware Blocker** today in **Microsoft Edge Preview** and take control of your online safety!
